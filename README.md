# Snake

Simple version of Snake implemented with pygame and pygame_gui.

This project was primarily created to explore and experiment with pygame_gui.

Since this was my first time building an UI, the code-structure probably sucks. I know what I do not like about it, and will eventually use this project as a reference for future projects (using pygame_gui).

Only one commit, since this project was (recklessly) build without using git.

Probably would need big refactor to make it look nice... I'll call it done.
